****AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE (ATM)**

## Introduction
The full form of ATM is Automated teller Machine, it is an electro-mechanical machine which consists of automated banking platforms that allow clients to perform smooth transactions without the assistance of a branch representative or teller. A debit card or credit cardholders should be able to withdraw cash at most ATMs.

ATMs are beneficial, allowing clients to conduct fast self-service transactions such as cash withdrawals, deposits, bill payments and account-to-account transfers. Fees are usually paid out for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is held, by the ATM operator, or both. Some of these charges can be avoided by using an ATM which is operated directly by the account holding bank.

## WORKING 
You need to insert plastic ATM cards inside the ATMs to start ATM operating. You have to drop your cards on some machines and some machines require card swapping. These ATM cards contain your account details and other security information on the magnetic stripe. When you drop or swap your card, the computer receives details about your account and requests for your PIN No. Once the authentication is valid, machines will permit cash transactions.
